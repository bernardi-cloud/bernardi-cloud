# Paolo Bernardi | Teaching and Research

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am **Paolo Bernardi**: a **PhD student in Computer Science (Quantum Computing)** at the University of Pisa and a **Computer Science Teacher** at IIS Casagrande-Cesi (Terni). My work bridges the gap between advanced research and high school education.

I am currently codifying my teaching method as **Hacker-Style Learning (HSL)**: focusing on real artifacts, rapid iteration, and responsibility.

👉 [Read more about HSL](https://www.bernardi.cloud/hsl)

I am also a registered software engineer (Ordine degli Ingegneri di Terni, A1364) with 15+ years of experience in system design, cybersecurity, and privacy.
